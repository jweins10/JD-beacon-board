 *    ways. Here, we can choose to interpret this piece of memory as a structure of
 *    individual board state elements, or as a single "whole" value. This allows us
 *    to either work with the individual pieces of the board state, or with the 
 *    whole piece of memory-- which allows us to easily transmit these states.
 *  - A bitfield structure, which allows us to actually create variables which are
 *    smaller than a byte! Note that, since the AVR CPU doesn't directly support
 *    addressing values that aren't smaller than a byte (with limited exception),
 *    the C compiler will actually automatically create the masking code _for_ you.
